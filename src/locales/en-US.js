  'staking.faq.answer.1':
    'ETH 2.0 refers to the last of the four stages of ETH development, which are: Frontier, Homestead, Metropolis and Serenity. The first three stages are under ETH 1.0, while in the fourth stage, ETH 1.0 will be upgraded to ETH 2.0, in which the PoW (Proof of Work) consensus mechanism will be upgraded to the PoS (Proof of Stake) consensus mechanism.',
  'staking.faq.question.2': 'Why the need to upgrade to ETH 2.0?',
  'staking.faq.answer.2.1': '1. Improve scalability',
  'staking.faq.answer.2.2':
    'At present, ETH 1.0 only supports about 15 transactions per second. In the future, ETH 2.0 will be composed of 64 or more shards, supporting, theoretically, hundreds and thousands of transactions per second. ETH 2.0 addresses over centralized issue of the mainnet computation power and improves scalability.',
  'staking.faq.answer.2.3': '2. Environmental sustainability',
  'staking.faq.answer.2.4':
    'Currently, ETH is still using the mainstream PoW (Proof of Work) consensus mechanism to run and maintain cybersecurity. Although the PoW model has certain advantages in ensuring security and its degree of decentralization, the nodes for maintaining cybersecurity are still expensive. Only one node will find the correct hash value and obtain the accounting rights and rewards in the end. However, all the other participating nodes in the world would have consumed a lot of computing power. This model is not only inefficient, but also a waste of environmental resources. Once upgraded to the PoS (Proof of Stake) consensus mechanism, ETH will no longer rely on large amounts of computing power and electricity to maintain and operate the network, and instead rely on the method of staking coins to create blocks and deals on the chain.',
  'staking.faq.answer.2.5': 'ETH 2.0 Roadmap',
  'staking.faq.answer.2.6':
    'Like ETH 1.0, ETH 2.0 will be divided into several stages. The most important are the first three stages: stage 0, stage 1 and stage 2.',
  'staking.faq.answer.2.7': 'Stage 0: Beacon chain',
  'staking.faq.answer.2.8':
    'ETH 2.0 will introduce Beacon Chain in Phase 0. Beacon Chain is totally new blockchain where the validators are able to participate in the staking system to run & maintain the network. It is the command and control center of the whole ETH 2.0 ecosystem.',
  'staking.faq.answer.2.9':
    'In Phase 0, ETH 2.0 does not support smart contract or asset transfer but only for running validation procedures, so users are unable to transfer the asset to exchanges at the phase.',
  'staking.faq.answer.2.10': 'Phase 1: Shard',
  'staking.faq.answer.2.11':
    'The main goal of phase 1 is to integrate the shard chain. In this phase, ETH1.0 and ETH2.0 will be merged. The shard chain is an expansion mechanism of the ETH network, i.e. the ETH blockchain will be divided into 64 different chains, with the data processing tasks assigned to many nodes, as to be processed in parallel. Each shard chain is like a diversion lane of the main road in the ETH network, this significantly improves the network processing capacity and brings higher throughput. View the shard roadmap.',
  'staking.faq.answer.2.12': 'Stage 2: Execution',
  'staking.faq.answer.2.13':
    'At present, the definition and function of stage 2 are still under reviewing: The shard function will be fully improved in stage 2, and each shard will manage eWASM-based (ETH WASM) virtual machine (EVM), which is compatible with smart contracts, it also supports transfer, cash withdrawal, inter-shard transfer and other functions, completes the merger of ETH 1.0 and ETH 2.0, and completely ends the use of PoW workload proof consensus mechanism.',
  'staking.faq.answer.2.14': 'Image source：https://eth2.ethereum.cn/',
  'staking.faq.answer.2.15':
    'eWASM (ETH WASM) is the solution of ETH2.0 to the bottleneck problem caused by Ethereum virtual machine (EVM). EVM is responsible for the internal state of ETH network and all its calculations, which has a significant impact on the speed of task execution and the availability of the whole network. eWASM is an open standard instruction set of W3C community group, developed by top engineers such as Google, Microsoft and Apple. It supports traditional programming languages such as C/C++ and 64 bit data processing, which can improve network processing speed and throughput, and enhance security and availability. ',
  'staking.faq.question.3': 'How to become an ETH 2.0 validator',
  'staking.faq.answer.3.1':
    'First, users shall stake 32 ETH into the deposit contract: https://etherscan.io/address/0x00000000219ab540356cBB839Cbe05303d7705Fa#tokentxns. Then, the user shall run ETH 1.0 and ETH 2.0 clients at the same time. After being a validator, your node must be online to verify blocks. Each successful block verification means some ETH airdrop for the validator. The staking APY is around 5 ~10%. If you are offline and miss the verification task of ETH network assigned by the beacon chain, you will be fined. Besides, intentional verification mistakes will result in the confiscation of the 32 ETH.',
  'staking.faq.answer.3.2':
    'ETH staked to the deposit contract is an irreversible deal. It needs to wait until ETH 2.0 reaches stage 1 for verification before transfer can be made. Therefore, it may take two or three years for Ethereum 2.0 to truly realize fragmentation and smart contract. This means that the validator has to bear the risk of failing to withdraw cash for at least two years. In addition, once ETH is staked to the beacon chain, BETH will be generated, and it will not be able to return to the main chain of ETH 1.0. This also means that if Ethereum 2.0 fails to upgrade, user assets may suffer losses. Therefore, it is not recommended that ordinary users become validators.',
